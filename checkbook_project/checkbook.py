# Jeffrey Hutchins -- Python Project -- Command Line Checkbook Application

# This .py file is to be accessed through the command line.  It will prompt the user to 
# choose a number 1-4 in order to see their current balance, withdraw money, deposit money, or exit.  The balance
# of the bank account will persist by using a .txt file for storage.


# !!! Text file must initially have a 0 in it to work correctly !!!

# Starts with my 3 functions.  
# while loop is below the 3 functions.
